the GUI is the object explore or SSMS (sequel server mgmt system)

hit the NEW QUERY button to bring up the query window

tables are organized into columns and rows (domains and entities!)

columns rep kind of data

rows are instances of the one type of data, like a name or a product

Normalization: 

design database to reduce redundancy
reduction of redundancy
each piece of data should be only stored once ideally

indexes: 
faster way to look up data
a cross reference of sorts
indexes duplicate key pieces of data and store them in sorted order

Constraints: 

way for sql server to prevent certain kinds of illegal data from entering a table (like verification)
created and applied as part of db design and enforced by server
breaking a constraint results in an error and operation is aborted.

types:

Unique: each value totally differnt
check: specific data types or values
default: a default!
not null: must contain a value
primary key: enforces unique value in column
foreign key: column may only contain values that appear in primary key
column of ref. table.

Primary key: field or fields that uniquely defin a record
is a constraint
permits column to be ref for foreign key
table can only have one primary key
an id number would be an example
sometimes made up or not (like a ssn)

Foreign Key: key that refernces a primary key in another table
usedto enforce referential integrity:
the order table has a cust id column and that can only contain value sfrom teh id colun of the cust id table

composite keys - key includes multi columns
may be dsignated as primary key

eg: combining more than one key to create a key, often a primary one

SQL structured query language: 
Microsofts version is called 'transact-sql'
	Two branches: data definition language and data manipulation language (DDL and DML)

DDL is used on the objects
DML is used on the data itself

Syntax: case insensitive - keywords are by convention uppercase, and end with semicolon.
white space insensitive

comments like js or css /*  blah blah blah */
single line comment is -- 

SELECT is one of the most common statements
retrieve oneor more rows

DML Understading:
used to insert data in, update and query a db

SELECT retrieves data
INSERT add rows
UPDATE change values in table
DELETE obv!
MERGE insert update, or delete based on another query result (JOINS)

Data definntion:

used to crateed the framework for the database the chema or both
USE: db you're using
CREATE: create obj
ALTER modify obj
DROP remove obj
TRUNCATE: remove obj - will remove all unused space from db

if you can't find an obj you just creaated, REFRESH!!
