foreign key relates tables together using one table's primary key.


DBMS is what stores and manages the databasese. The GUI is just a tool to make it easier.

Lesson 2: Creating DB Objects!

DataTypes:

Each column requires a datatype - the right kind is important for good dB design. Indicates type of data column will store.

Can be difficult to change once table contains data.

Data Type Catedories:

Exact numeric, approx numeric, date and time, char strings, unicode char strings, binary strings, other

Built-In and User-Defined Data Types:

built in are normally sufficient, but programmers can create their own (rare)

Built-In: 

Money(numeric), Datetime, integer, char, varchar, boolean, float

Numeric: 
Int: Primary Integer
Bit: 0, 1, or Null
Decimal and Numeric: fixed precision and scale
Money and smallmoney: Monetary values
Real or float: more precision, not oft used

Date & Time:
Date, datetime, datetime2, datetimeoffset, smalldatetime, and time
differing ranges, for efficiency
datetimeoffset tracks timezone

String:
NChar, NVarChar - for unicode (international languages, 2bytes as opposed to one - the unicode double byte character set (DBCS)
Char: Fixed length 1 byte per letter as opposed to 2 with VarChar
VarChar(x) Variable length up to max declared, stored in row
VarChar(MAX) up to 8kb in row, max 2gig

look up the data type list and see how many bytes things take up

Blob - binary large object 
stored outside the page - on one or more successive pages
main row has pointer to blob
Good for blocks of text, image data, binary file data, movies etc.
not the most efficient thing for SQLServer - use SQL filestream instead.

Creating tables in the GUI

To get rid of the red squiggly lines, as long as everything is working 'CTRL SHIFt R' baby whoo hoo!!!

dbo = database only
