database is an organized way of storing similar data, made for manipulating data quickly.
input, namage organize and retrieve data quickly
rows and columns

like a filing cabinet

data collected by user actions

stored on the database


Key Terms: 

Query: instruction for retrieving data

INdex: data structure that helps to speed up selected queries

database server: server taht stores databases and responds to  queries - often one default and a few instances - multiple servers speed performance and increase security.
sometimes used in a low level environment like a sandbox - on it's own. High availability.
Often a high end machine
can be and often is remote
fast! lots of memory. many multicore processors. fast connections. multiple machines.
Access: typically limited - typically log in over a network. Commands issued remotely, processeed and returned by the DBMS
Storage: three types of file:
	MDF primary data file
	LDF log file
	NDF secondary dataa file
local machine can be a server 

database mgmt system: collection of apps that enables you to enter organize and select data eg: Sequel server SQL is a relational DBMS
the word relational is irrelevant - both terms are interchangeable - the important thing is the DBMS is a system, the collection of programss needed 
to manipulate the data.

prevent replication andinmprove performance

flat file databases - super simple rows and columns - other filetypes comma separated values(CSV), tab delimited (TDF) - text files 

heirarchical databases - like a family tree, parent items with child items. (one to many)

relational databases - multiple flat-file databases which are connected or related in some way. (one to many, or many to many)

database vs spreadsheet:

	both can:
	
	organized into tables
	columns can do calculations and formulas

	only dbs can:

	massive amounts of data
	query data quickly
	able to maximize resources and users
